# Contributing to prism-secret-scan

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! prism-secret-scan is a command-line tool by [Prism Protocol](https://github.com/krishyaa06) — Zero-dependency CLI with 28 detectors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, GitHub, AWS, Stripe, Discord…) that scans your files and full git history for leaked secrets, masks output and speaks SARIF.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishyaa06/prism-secret-scan.git
cd prism-secret-scan
```

## Before you open a pull request

Make sure everything passes locally:

```bash
npm test
```

## Guidelines

- **Zero dependencies.** Please don't add runtime dependencies — use Node.js built-ins (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:test`, …).
- Keep pull requests small and focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Update the README when you change behaviour, flags or options.

## Commit messages
